I am currently a Ph.D. student at Purdue University working on Neuro-Symbolic (Nesy) and software/hardware co-design for CiM under the supervision of Professor Haitong Li in NanoX Lab.

During Purdue, i focus on the analog design of Fused Analog CiM designa and Nesy algorithm design for better reasoning!

During ZJU, I was the group leader of the RRAM-eDRAM hybrid CiM design program. In my role, I focus on algorithm development (SNN-based vision models) and optimization, the system level spec design, partly of the digital parts of the system, and dealing with the critical features of heterogenous integration of CiM. From the algorithm part, I also focus on some new machine learning aspects: Multimodal learning in SNN, hybrid DNN-HDC, etc. I interned at  <a href="https://vlsi.rice.edu/">SIMS Lab</a>, led by Prof.Kaiyuan Yang, to work on the design of charge domain CiM in 2022 summer, and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/NanoX/">NanoX Lab</a>, led by Prof.Haitong Li, to work on the design of Hyperdimensional computing in 2023 summer.

Before ZJU, I received my B.S. from the Department of Optics and Electronic Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. During my time there, I worked on various projects in silicon photonics, Machine Learning, and inverse optimization. I spent a semester as a research assistant at Chen Lin's Lab, working on a project to design achromatic metalenses.
